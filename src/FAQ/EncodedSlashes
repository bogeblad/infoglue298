If you run Apache in front of InfoGlue and run portlets or similar you may get invalid URL-errors.
This may be because of escaped slashes in the url - check out this:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#allowencodedslashes

You just need to add this to the httpd.conf

AllowEncodedSlashes On
